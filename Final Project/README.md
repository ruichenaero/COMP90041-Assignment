## Moral Machine
The idea of Moral Machines is based on theTrolley Dilemma, a fictional scenario presenting a decisionmaker with a moral dilemma:  choosing ”the lesser of two evils”.  The scenario
entails an autonomous carwhose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing.  As it is too late to relinquish control to the car’s passengers,the car needs to make a decision based on the
facts available about the situation.  Figure 1 shows an example  scenario.   In  this  project,  you  will  create  an Ethical  Engine,  a  program  designed  to  explore
different scenarios, build an algorithm to decide between the life of the car’s passengersvs.the life of the pedestrians, audit your decision-making algorithm through simulations,
and allow users of your program to judge the outcomes themselves.

Figure 1:  Scenario example:  a self-driving car approaches a pedestrian crossing but its breaks fail.  Youralgorithm needs to decide between two cases.Left:  The car will continue ahead and drive through thecrossing  resulting  in  one  elderly  man,  one  pregnant  woman,  one  boy,  and  one  dog  losing  their  lives.Right:The car will swerve and crash into a concrete barrier resulting in the death of its passengers:  onewomen, one man, and one baby.  Note that the pedestrians abide by the law as they are crossing on agreen signal (image source:  http://moralmachine.mit.edu/)
